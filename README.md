# Credit Score Classification with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Credit Score Classification project! This repository contains a machine learning solution for the task of classifying credit applicants into different risk categories based on various financial features.

## Overview

In today's financial world, assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants is a critical task. Lenders need to determine the likelihood that a borrower will repay their loan on time. This project leverages the power of machine learning to build a predictive model that categorizes applicants into risk groups:

- **Low Risk**: Applicants who are likely to repay their loans without issues.
- **Medium Risk**: Applicants who may have a moderate risk of defaulting.
- **High Risk**: Applicants who are at a higher risk of defaulting on their loans.

The model's predictions can assist financial institutions, such as banks and credit agencies, in making informed decisions about extending credit.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for machine learning.
- **Machine Learning Models**: We explore various classification algorithms, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting, to find the best model for credit score classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: We provide visualizations to help interpret the results and gain insights into the data.
